# ProgrammingforDA-assignment
This repository contains my assigment submission for the Programming for Data Analytics module, as part of the Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Data Analytics) course at GMIT.  

The assignment document is written as a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and saved in this repository as **Programming for Data Analysis Assignment.ipynb**.  In order to run the assignment Notebook it needs to be saved locally as a .ipynb file and accessed from the command line using the command "Jupyter Notebook" which will open it in a web browser tab.

The repository also contains some image files that have been linked in the assignment document.
